# Self-Driving-Car

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project simulates a self-driving car in a web environment using JavaScript. It showcases the integration of neural networks and simulation of car physics to create a car that autonomously navigates a virtual road.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Simulation of car dynamics including speed, acceleration, and steering.</li>
    <li>Implementation of a neural network for autonomous decision-making.</li>
    <li>Use of sensors to detect and react to the environment.</li>
    <li>Creation of traffic for a dynamic driving experience.</li>
    <li>Manual and AI control modes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>JavaScript for logic and simulation.</li>
    <li>HTML5 Canvas for rendering the simulation.</li>
    <li>CSS for basic styling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Car class for handling movement and collision.</li>
    <li>Controls class for input handling.</li>
    <li>NeuralNetwork and Level classes for AI decision-making.</li>
    <li>Sensor class for environmental awareness.</li>
    <li>Road class for road and lane generation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the Simulation</h2>
<p>To run the simulation:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open <code>index.html</code> in a modern web browser.</li>
    <li>Use the arrow keys to manually control the car or switch to AI mode to watch the car drive itself.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enhancing the neural network for better decision-making.</li>
    <li>Improving the physics for more realistic car behavior.</li>
    <li>Adding more interactive elements to the UI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project is an exploration into the realms of AI and physics simulation, demonstrating how a machine can interpret and respond to its surroundings in real-time.</p>
